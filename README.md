### Hi, I'm Stefano üëã

I bridge the gaps between humans and machines.

I consider myself a **UXer first** and a writer second. I'm passionate about products at a 360-degree level, which is why I‚Äôve trained in product management, front-end development, and API design.

My career has been focused on building and scaling content practices from the ground up, working in teams of all sizes, scopes, and maturity levels. I have:

* Founded and kickstarted entire technical writing and UX writing practices.
* Led full documentation migrations, rebuilding developer portals and doc stacks from scratch.
* Championed strategic initiatives like "knowledge-as-a-product" and led content design system initiatives.
* Created company-wide style tools and resources and built automations to improve writers' workflows.
* Hired, and mentored writers
* Managed localization, and led tool procurement.
* [Published tools and frameworks](#-frameworks--writing-elsewhere) in industry zines like UX Collective and UX Content Collective](#-frameworks--writing-elsewhere)
* ...and always fought to make sure content and UX have a seat at the table.

### Some samples of my work

My repositories are a mix of vibe-coded projects, experiments, and tools I've built to solve problems I've faced. They're by no means not tidy and organized, so here's some highlights for you:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tools (On GitHub)

You'll find these repositories here on my profile:

* **[`steroman/readme-docs-as-code-toolkit`](https://github.com/steroman/readme-docs-as-code-toolkit)**
    * A toolkit I built to establish a docs-as-code approach using the legacy version of the Readme.com API.

* **[`steroman/max-char-length-calculator`](https://github.com/steroman/max-char-length-calculator)**
    * A companion app for the framework I developed to calculate UI character limits based on real data, not just guesses.

* **[`steroman/limoncello`](https://github.com/steroman/limoncello)**
    * A simple app to calculate the ingredients and final alcoholic volume for making homemade limoncello.

#### üí° Frameworks & writing (Elsewhere)

Here's some frameworks and approaches I've been sharing with the community:

* **[A formula for defining maximum character lengths](https://uxcontent.com/a-formula-for-defining-maximum-character-lengths/)** (Published on **UX Content Collective**)
    * This is the article that details the formula behind the calculator tool.

* **[Prioritize content design work like a pro with RICE](https://uxdesign.cc/prioritize-content-design-work-like-a-pro-with-rice-cf5305b6c297)** (Published on **UX Collective**)
    * My adaptation of the popular RICE prioritization framework, modified for the unique challenges of content design teams.

#### üåç Community

I'm proud to collaborate with and contribute to global communities:

* [**Sustainable software manifesto**](https://sustainablemanifesto.org/)
    * I'm currently collaborating as a project manager, workshop facilitator, and writer in the creation of this manifesto.

* [**Content design manifesto**](https://thisiscontent.design/)
    * I contributed as the official Catalan translator for the project.
